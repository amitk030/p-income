# 1. Requirements

This project uses Docker and Docker-Compose **only**


## Docker

Follow the steps to install Docker if you don't have it already.

The steps can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

For your convenience, here are the steps to install Docker on a Debian/Raspbian OS :

```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
curl -fsSL test.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh
sudo usermod -aG docker docker_user
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
groups ${USER}
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo reboot
```

## Docker-Compose

Follow the steps to install Docker-Compose if you don't have it already.

The steps can be found here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
For your convenience, here are the steps to install Docker-Compose on a Debian/Raspbian OS :

```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose

- OR -

sudo apt install docker-compose
```

# 2. Installation

First, clone this repository.

Here are two different techniques

- Method 1: Download as Zip

On this webpage, click on the green button "<> Code" and then "Download ZIP".
Unzip the zip, and verify that you have a folder named `p-income` containing this repo.

- Method 2: Using git clone

The following command will create a folder `` and clone the repository inside it.

```
git clone https://github.com/amitk030/p-income.git p-income
cd p-income
```

Once done, I recommend that you move the directory called `p-income` to somewhere safe on your device. Don't leave it in the `Downloads` folder, because you might delete it in the future.


-------------
# 3. Configuration

The following steps will guide you through the account creation and the configuration.

During these steps, you'll be required to open your copy of the [`.env`](.env) located in your `p-income` directory with a text editor such as `vim`, `sublime text`, `NotePad`, `TextEdit`. Then, follow the next steps and find/replace each "Variable" by your own value (email address, password, identification, ... it depends on the application).

## Yields

These apps won't use much RAM/CPU, but should you need to narrow down these apps to the best ones only, each app is ranked using the following emojis:

- 游릴 High yield earnings
- 游릲 Medium yield earnings
- 游릶 Low yield earnings
- 游린 Very low yield earnings
 
Feel free to remove the apps you do not want by simply commenting the relevant configuration part in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](docker-compose.yaml).

Please note that this rank is based on my experience using those apps in IND (the earnings depends mostly on your location but also internet speed and other factors).
If you do not live in the IND, I recommend that you try them out first and review the earnings after a few weeks.
